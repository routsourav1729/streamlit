# 🌸 Iris Flower Species Prediction App - Deployment Example

This repository is a simple example used in the DS 203 course at IIT Bombay to demonstrate how to deploy a machine learning model as a web app using Streamlit. The app predicts the species of an Iris flower based on user inputs for sepal and petal measurements.

## 📝 Overview

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Streamlit, scikit-learn, pandas
- **Purpose**: Serve as a deployment example for students learning how to deploy apps using Streamlit in the DS 203 class.

## 🌟 Features of the App

- **User Input**: Users can input sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width through sliders.
- **Real-time Prediction**: The app predicts the species of the Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) instantly based on the inputs.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the app provides a simple and user-friendly interface.

## 📂 Files in This Repository

- **`ml_model.py`**: The Python script that contains the Streamlit app code.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing all the necessary Python packages for running the app.
